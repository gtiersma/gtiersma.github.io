# Portfolio Website 2.0

A portfolio website I designed for myself. This is a replacement for [my original portfolio website](https://github.com/gtiersma/gtiersma.github.io). It features updated, cleaner code, more stability and an improved UI.

This is the distribution branch. It does not contain the source code and only exists to serve the purpose of providing the compiled website for hosting.

## Technologies Used

- Vue 3.0 Composition API
- Vite
- TypeScript
- GSAP
- Bootstrap (limited usage)
