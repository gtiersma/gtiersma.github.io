# Portfolio Website 2.0

A portfolio website I designed for myself. This is a replacement for [my original portfolio website](https://github.com/gtiersma/gtiersma.github.io). It features updated, cleaner code, more stability and an improved UI.

## Technologies Used

- Vue 3.0 Composition API
- Vite
- TypeScript
- GSAP
- Bootstrap (limited usage)
